# Automation to search a word/phrase inside any folder(s) with an audio assistance 

Added changes to a file and don't remember which nested folder(s) it was saved into ðŸ˜Ÿ ! 

Here comes this executable to the rescue.

Execute the SearchWordInFiles.exe file(inside zip) and search a word or phrase in any folder(s) with an audio assistance.

Reference to the code: https://github.com/shrutisawant6/automation-with-speech-search-code.git

Audio compatible on Windows, it automatically turns off if not compatible(you can even choose).
