# Automation to search a word inside any folder(s) with an audio

Added details to a file and dont know which nested folder its saved in! Here this executable comes to the rescue.

Execute the SearchWordInFiles.exe file and search any word inside any folder(s) with audio assistance.

Reference to the code: https://github.com/shrutisawant6/automation-with-speech-search-code.git

Audio compatible on Windows, it automatically turns off if not compatible(you can even choose).
